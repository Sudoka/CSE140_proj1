In my test code I more or less reused the sample test case, but I tried to use combinations of all the arithmetic operations to load the appropriate values into the input registers. The goal was to make sure that by using all of the instructions with the correct values, I could manipulate the values to end up spitting out the same result as the sample test code did. Basically I was lazy and reused the test code because it already implemented a few of the instructions that I needed to make sure would work, so I just added the rest of the instructions into the code to test the rest of them.
